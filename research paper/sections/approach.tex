\section{Approach}
% In computer science typically the third section contains an exposition of the main ideas, for example the development of a theory, the analysis of the problem (some proofs), a new algorithm, and potentially some theoretical analysis of the properties of the algorithm.

% Do not forget to give this section another name, for example after the method or idea you are presenting.

% Some more detailed suggestions for typical types of contributions in computer science are described in the following subsections.

Over time, transformer models have been scaled to enormous sizes with hundreds of billions of parameters with the goal of improving performance. This made the models less sustainable and more expensive both to train and operate due to the computational requirements induced by the scaling. 

For this reason, the experiments in this study are conducted on much smaller models trained on the TinyStories dataset. The dataset was specifically designed to facilitate the trained models' sample efficiency by being more cohesive and suitable for learning English grammar and vocabulary \cite{eldan_tinystories_2023}. The same study has shown that smaller models with fewer parameters, if are sample-efficient, can preserve the ability to generate coherent, diverse, and consistent results demonstrating some reasoning capabilities. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mention again using a decoder-only model (which is GPT-Neo)
    \item Add a nice figure of the workflow of experiments (kqv size - GQA - Different number of attention heads)
    \item Explain (briefly) why reducing the kqv vector size should help
    \item Explain that GQA was adjusted a bit given a small number of attention heads (not equal group sizes)
    \item Mention that we widen FFN to compensate for having less parameters \cite{shazeer_fast_2019}
    \item Inroduce a math formula to adjust FFN based on the KQV factor and number of query groups
    \item Explain how ratios of groups to the total number of heads work across different numbers of heads.
\end{itemize}



% This research will test different architectural decisions for the attention mechanism in transformer models via the TinyStories dataset. To achieve this, small models such as RoBERTa\footnotemark[1]{} and GPT-Neo\footnotemark[2]{} will be used to test the decisions while covering both text processing and text generation types of tasks. Then, the performance of both models for different architectural decisions will be evaluated with different metrics included in the BabyLM evaluation pipeline\footnotemark[3]{}.

% The architectural decisions tested in this research will be the multi-query attention mechanism, the grouped-query mechanism, and the standard multi-head mechanism with a reduced size of query/key vectors. All of them are expected to increase the inference speed due to a reduction in memory overhead \cite{ainslie_gqa_2023} \cite{shazeer_fast_2019}. 

% \textit{Introduce the time complexity analysis and how the memory affects it. Also, mention that we are testing at the pre-training stage. And, mention why it could be beneficial to have it done at the pre-training stage. Maybe also mention the changing number of attention heads as a gap from the previous research.}


\subsection*{Experimental work}
In this case, this section will mostly contain a description of the methods/algorithms you will be comparing. Although not all methods need to be described in detail (providing appropriate references are available), make sure that you reveal sufficient details to a reader not familiar with these methods to: a) obtain a high-level understanding of the method and differences between them, and b) understand your explanation of the results/conclusions.

\subsection*{Improvement of an idea}
In this case, you would need to explain in detail how the improvement works. If it is based on some observation that can be proven, this is a good place to provide that proof (e.g., of the correctness of your approach). 

\subsection*{Literature survey}
If your contribution is a literature survey, then the organization of these ``middle'' sections very much depends on the way you want to present/organize the literature you are discussing.
First try to cluster papers that are similar in some aspect. Then think of how these clusters are related, from that you can think of a good order to discuss these clusters; this is sometimes called a bottom-up approach to writing a paper.

In addition, you may try to think about the organization of the literature from a top-down perspective: try to ``take a step back'' and think about the field and what important questions/variants are and build a hierarchical categorization of the field.

Make clear what your contribution is here: a new organization of the literature, identification of open problems/challenges, new parallels/generalizations, a table with pros/cons of different methods, etc.\
